Abstract:
Essentially, when you use your computer your CPU attempts to predict what values you will need and preemptively stores them in the cache which allows for faster access time. In this program we succeeded in creating a program that called values from increasingly large arrays in an unpredictable way so that the computer is not able to precaching the values we call. This allows us to observe accurate access times between values in the L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, and DRAM.
