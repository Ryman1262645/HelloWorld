# HelloWorld
A project by Josh Reiss and Ryan Neumann

CS389_HW1 Contains our first homework assignment, described here (Reed login required to read): https://moodle.reed.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=87847

Abstract:
Essentially, when you use your computer your CPU attempts to predict what values you will need and preemptively stores them in the cache which allows for faster access time. In this project we succeed in creating a program that calls values from an increasingly large array in an unpredictable way so that the CPU is unable to precaching the values we call. This allows us to observe accurate access times between values in the L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, and DRAM.
